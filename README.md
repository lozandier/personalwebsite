Personal Website
===============

Personal Website using Rails 4

MVP of a a personal site that'll be showcasing my work with Rails 4+. 

## Goals 
- Deviate from usual Content Wireframe w/ Mixture.io/SassMeister -> Text -> Sketch -> Web Mockup -> Production Tweak workflow (Stephen Hay) and do everything within Rails at first 



**Current Status**
- <del>Asset-related issues are being resolved at the moment.</del> Deal with extra slow JSON compilation  
- Decide whether or not this was a failed attempt to break away from my workflow, is this a worthwhile endeavor just to take advantage of Rails built-in Asset pipeline? 
- Better integrate `high_voltage` 
- Create regression tests (A pitfall of doing everything within Rails) 
- Upgrade to Rails 4.1 that lead you to do this experiment in the first place while  waiting for it to be more stable (as well as Foundation 5) + do your usual replacement of Foundation to Singularitygs.
